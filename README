# Data Engineering SQL & Python Portfolio

**Automated ETL Pipeline**  
![ETL Status] https://github.com/Dpride5/data-engineering-python-portfolio/actions/workflows/run_etl.yml/badge.svg

This repo demonstrates end-to-end data-engineering skills:
- **SQL**: complex queries, window functions, CTEs  (See data-engineering-sql-portfolio)
- **Python & Pandas**: data loading, cleaning, aggregation, running totals  
- **ETL Automation**: CLI script (`argparse`) & GitHub Action (scheduled + onâ€‘push)  
- **Database Load**: writes aggregated data into SQLite (`timesheet.db`)

timesheet_etl_dag.py runs nightly at 3 AM: executes Python ETL to write cleaned Parquet, then a downstream task checks row-count in the target DB and fails the run if zero rows, surfacing alerts in Airflow's UI.
